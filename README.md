# Robotic Arm Controller with Tensorflow Object Detection
This is software for running a 4 DOF robotic arm. It is written in C++ and has a connection server running on a Raspberry Pi which is connected to servos that drive the joints and a camera. The server allows clients to connect over TCP sockets to send commands and receive video. This allows the remote control client to run the arm, which gives a graphical interface for controlling the arm manually and runs a Tensorflow lite object detection model to try and target objects. Models can be trained through Google Cloud's vision API for different objects.
